# Win32-NetConnections

Simple demonstration of enumerating TCP-UDP/IP connections to PIDs & Process Names.

## 🚀 Features
- Display TCP and/or UDP connections with their process information

## 📦 Requirements
- PcapPlusPlus (https://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus)

## ‼️ Warning
- The UDP connections mapper object can't display the remote host and port due to a limitation in this chosen API function. Will fix it soon
